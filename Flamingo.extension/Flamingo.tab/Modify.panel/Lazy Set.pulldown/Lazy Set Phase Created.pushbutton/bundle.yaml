title: Lazy Set Phase Created
tooltip: >-
  Sets the phase the selected elements where created. If the element does not allow for
  phase created to be set because it is hosted to another element, the element will be
  skipped.

  This tool is helpful for setting the phase created for a lot of elements in the model
  without the need to filter out elements hosted to other elements.
