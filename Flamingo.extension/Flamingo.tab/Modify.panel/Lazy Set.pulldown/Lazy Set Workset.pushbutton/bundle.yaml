title: Lazy Set Workset
tooltip: >-
  Sets the workset of an element. If the element does not allow for a workset
  to be set because it is hosted to another element, the element will be
  skipped.

  This tool is helpful for setting a workset for a lot of elements in the model at once
  without the need to filter out elements hosted to other elements.
