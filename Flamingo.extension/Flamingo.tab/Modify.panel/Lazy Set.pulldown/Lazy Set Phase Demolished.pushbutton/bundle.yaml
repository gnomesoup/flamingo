title: Lazy Set Phase Demolished
tooltip: >-
  Sets the phase the selected elements where demolished. If the element does not
  allow for phase demolished to be set because it is hosted to another element,
  the element will be skipped.

  This tool is helpful for setting the phase demolished for a lot of elements in
  the model without the need to filter out elements hosted to other elements.
