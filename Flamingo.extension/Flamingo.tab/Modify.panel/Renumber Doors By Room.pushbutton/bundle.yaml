tooltip: >-
  Renumbers the doors in the active view by room number. Attempts to renumber
  doors for rooms that only have a single door first, moving up to the room with
  the most connected rooms. Rooms with multiple doors will append an alpha
  character to the end of the door number (e.g. 101A, 101B). Pre-select doors
  before running the command to limit the doors that are renumbered.
