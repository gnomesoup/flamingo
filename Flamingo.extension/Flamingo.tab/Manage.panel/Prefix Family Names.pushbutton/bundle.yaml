title: 'Prefix/nFamily Names'
tooltip: >-
  Rename all non-system families in the project to include a pre-defined prefix
  per family category. For example, a family named "Television" that is set to
  the category "Speciality Equipment" would be renamed to "SE_Television". This
  groups all families of the same category together when placing using the
  "Place component" command or selecting from the type selector.

  Families that have their own commands (doors, windows, etc.) will not be
  renamed.
