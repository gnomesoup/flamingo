title: "Material\nAsset Swap"
tooltip: >
  Change the asset assigned to all materials in the model. A single asset can
  be chosen to give the model a monotone appearance with just a click. Material
  assests can then be changed one by one to highlight specific materials in the
  model.


  An asset map file is saved before the swap to record the previous state of the
  model assets. This file can be loaded to return to the previous material
  state.
