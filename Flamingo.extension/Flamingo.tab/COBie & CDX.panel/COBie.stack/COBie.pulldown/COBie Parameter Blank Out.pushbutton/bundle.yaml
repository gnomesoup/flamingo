title: "Parameter \nBlank Out"
tooltip: >-
  Clears out unused COBie parameters. This is helpful to remove data that is
  not part of the COBie delieverable at the particular project stage. 
  
  For example, Manufacturer is not to be filled out at the end of Construction
  Documents, so this utility can be used to clear the COBie.Type.Manufacturer
  values for all elements in the model.
