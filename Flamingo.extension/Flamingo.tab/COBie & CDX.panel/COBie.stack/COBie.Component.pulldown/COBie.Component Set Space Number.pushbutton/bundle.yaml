title: COBie.Component Set Space Number
tooltip: >-
  Fuzzy matching of a room to components set to be exported in the
  COBie.Component schedule. If the Space parameter is blank, the room number
  will be pulled from the room parameter in Revit. If the family instance is
  not reporting a room number, an attempt will be made to match the component
  to the appropriate room number. If a room number is listed that is not
  included in the COBie.Space schedule, a warning will be returned.
