title: COBie.Component Auto-Select
tooltip: >-
  Checks the "COBie" checkbox for all instances of the families that are enabled
  in the COBie.Types schedule and are located in rooms that are also enabled in
  the COBie.Space schedule. If the COBie.Component.Space command is blank, run 
  the flamingo "COBie.Component Set Space Names" command and run this tool
  again.


  This command is less intensive than the BIM Interoperability Tools "Select"
  command and can act as a replacement, but requires that the families in
  COBie.Types be manually enabled, the COBie checkbox needs to be checked,
  before running.
