title: COBie Uncheck Unselected
tooltip: >-
  De-selects all COBie and COBie.Type checkboxes in the model. Run this before
  running the BIM Interoperability Tools Select command to avoid selection
  errors. This command only effects elements that are in an unselected state
  (greyed out checkbox). Previously checked/unchecked elements will remain
  unchanged.
